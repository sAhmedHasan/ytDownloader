Downloads audio and video from a YouTube link

This project involved creating a YouTube video and audio downloader using Tkinter and the Pytube library. 

I learned how to fetch YouTube videos' data, including title and available streams, and download them. 

The application featured a user interface with input fields for YouTube links, buttons to initiate downloads, and progress indicators. 

I gained practical experience in GUI development, handling external libraries, and implementing download functionalities.

I'm planning on adding more options for the video quality.
